# esp8266-wifi-motor-control-via-keyboard

This project showcases a simple yet powerful motor control system using the ESP8266 microcontroller. Leveraging Wi-Fi connectivity, the ESP8266 creates a web server that allows you to control the motor's direction and speed via keyboard input.

How to Use:

    1. Connect the ESP8266 to your Wi-Fi network.
    2. Access the web interface and use keyboard commands ('w' for forward, 's' to stop) to control the motor.
    3. Explore the codebase to understand and customize the functionality for your unique applications.

Dependencies:

    ESP8266WiFi library
    ESP8266WebServer library

Getting Started:

    - Clone or download the repository.
    - Set up your Arduino IDE with the required libraries.
    - Upload the code to your ESP8266 board.
    - Connect the motor control pins and power up the system.
    - Access the web interface and start controlling the motor wirelessly!
